# Sound-Web-Page
This was a proyect a made to practice my knowledge in HTML and CSS following a guide from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5fCIhI0FyE&t=53s">video</a><br>
In this page you can click on the play icon to play a song, the icon will change to a pause icon and if you click on it again the music will stop<br>
You can see the final result <a href="https://jhonabanguera.github.io/Sound-Web-Page/">Here</a>
